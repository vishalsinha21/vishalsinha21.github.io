Finally, after lot of research, zeroed in on Github Pages for blogging! I wanted something with minimalistic look, high performance and familiarity. Github with Jekyll doing the job in the background seems like a good start. Mapping with custom domain name was super easy and TinyPress for editing post would come handy from time to time.

Github Pages, I have high expectations from you.

Thank you TinyPress for boot strapping this for me.
